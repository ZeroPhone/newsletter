Like this project? Here are some ways you can help:

## Contribute

The project's contribution priorities are [kept in the ZeroPhone Wiki](wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Contribution_Priorities), so if you're interested in contributing, pick one of the priorities described =) Beforehand, visit our IRC channel - #ZeroPhone on Freenode [(webchat)](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ZeroPhone), or email me (zerophone on protonmail.com), same goes if you want to talk about any other ways you could help the project.

## Donate
<span id="donate"></span>
I'm more than happy to spend my time on this project, but I still need to order components, iterate on PCB design and cover other expenses like shipping, so there are project-relatedexpenses I need to be covered from time to time. You can donate [here](https://www.paypal.me/TheZeroPhone) using PayPal, or on 1PTvacVfBVB3LKRemaLwM5BQ9AdhmhqeY2 using BitCoin. 

## Fill in this survey

I have [a small survey]({{site.baseurl}}/survey/) you could complete, so that I can understand if ZeroPhone project is moving in the right direction - the responses I get are very useful, helping add new features, address your concerns and get new ideas!

## Spread the word

Your friends could be interested in this phone? Got a blog and some readers waiting for you to tell about exciting projects like this one? Tell others about it!
