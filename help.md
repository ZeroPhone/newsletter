The project's development takes place on [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/19035).

## Donate

We need to order components, iterate on PCB design and cover other expenses like shipping. Also, now I'm aiming to build a batch of beta phone kits (to send them to beta testers and independent reviewers) and that's a large expense that you could help us with - to allow for better testing and independent reviews.

You can donate [here](https://www.paypal.me/ZeroPhone) using PayPal.
