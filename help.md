Like this project? Here are some ways you can help:

## Contribute

The project's contribution priorities are [kept in the ZeroPhone Wiki](wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Contribution_Priorities), so if you're interested in contributing, pick one of the priorities described =) Also, visit our IRC channel - #ZeroPhone on Freenode -, or email me (zerophone on protonmail.com) if you want to talk about any other ways you could help the project.

## Donate

We need to order components, iterate on PCB design and cover other expenses like shipping. Also, a batch of ZeroPhones will soon be built (to send them to contributors and independent reviewers), and we still have shipping costs to be covered

You can donate [here](https://www.paypal.me/ZeroPhone) using PayPal. If you want to donate using Bitcoin, email the same address on protonmail.com as mentioned in Contribute part, and we can figure it out.


## Fill in this survey

We have [a small survey]({{site.baseurl}}/survey/) you could complete, so that we can understand if ZeroPhone project is moving in the right direction - the responses I get are very useful, helping add new features, address your concerns and get new ideas!
