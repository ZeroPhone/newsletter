# ZeroPhone Delta assembly stream now @Twitch ; Twitter

   
 I've finally finished sourcing the components for a batch of 20 Delta ZeroPhones - but first, I need to assemble the first one and check whether it works at all! (it's going to work, of course, the question is - how much many things will go wrong before it does). So, this is what I'm going to do now, and you can follow the build and ask me questions about the project live, over at [twitch.tv/crimier](https://www.twitch.tv/crimier) . This is a USA-centric stream - most of the Europe is asleep by now, but I really need to assemble these PCBs as soon as possible, because of a small pre-crowdfunding event I'm organizing that you'll be able to participate in =) I'll be making streams for Europe soon as well, don't worry - oh, and the video is going to be stored at Twitch!  
   
 Sorry for the timing - I see that people in NY are going to sleep now (the west coast has it a little bit better). I plan to stream for 4-5 hours - doing as much assembly and testing as I can cram into that time. Nevertheless, even if you're going to sleep soon, feel free to drop by and ask your questions in the chat - I'll be happy to answer! (nothing violating Twitch ToS, please =D )  
   
 Answering the "when's the crowdfunding" question that's asked often lately - it's very, very soon. I'm already preparing the pick&place for the Delta batch assembly, and as soon as I get phones, I'll be sending them to reviewers - which is one of the last have-to-do's before the crowdfunding.   
   
 Last but not least, [I'm more active on Twitter now](https://twitter.com/@ZeroPhoneOSHW) - posting status updates, some in-process photos etc. If you're not following me there yet, this is a way you can get more granular updates about what's going on, and the problems I'm solving on the way =)
