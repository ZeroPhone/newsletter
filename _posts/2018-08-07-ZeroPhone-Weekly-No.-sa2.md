# ZeroPhone Delta assembly stream & Q&A continuing

   
 I'm continuing the Twitch stream - now it's a little bit more timing-friendly towards people in New York (or so I hope). I do not intend to continue bombarding you with letters, so next newsletter (a proper one) is going to contain information about ways you can be notified about streams. As for now, we're going to be testing the ZeroPhone delta back board, assembling the front board, as well as talking all things ZeroPhone! [twitch.tv/crimier](https://twitch.tv/crimier)
